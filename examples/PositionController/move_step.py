move_step.py
============

This script controls the movement of the iCub humanoid robot's head and torso using a full-body step motion.
It demonstrates how to create limb motion sequences, define a structured step, and execute synchronized movements.

Usage:
------
Run this script to execute a predefined movement sequence for the iCubâ€™s head and torso.

    Defines a full-body step for the iCub humanoid robot involving both head and torso movements.

    Methods
    -------
    prepare()
        Initializes the step by creating limb motion trajectories for the head and torso.

        Prepares the movement sequences for the head and torso.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Creates a limb motion trajectory for the head.
        2. Creates a limb motion trajectory for the torso.
        3. Adds predefined poses for each body part.

        -------

    Executes a predefined full-body step for the iCub's head and torso.

    Steps
    -----
    1. Initializes an iCub instance.
    2. Creates and prepares a `HeadTorsoStep` motion sequence.
    3. Executes the movement step on the iCub.

    Example
    -------
    >>> execute_fullbody_step()

    Notes
    -----
    - The step is structured using `iCubFullbodyStep` for better modularity.
    - Head and torso movements are executed in a synchronized manner.
