3.lookat_events.py
==================

This script controls the gaze movement of the iCub humanoid robot with event-based motion monitoring.
It demonstrates how to direct the robotâ€™s gaze to a specific point, detect the motion onset, 
wait for the motion to complete, and reset the gaze.

Usage:
------
Run this script to move the iCub's gaze while detecting when the movement starts and ends.

def look_at_fixation_point_with_events(x: float = -1.0, y: float = -0.5, z: float = 1.0):
    """
    Moves the iCub's gaze to a specific 3D fixation point and monitors the motion onset and completion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float, optional
        The x-coordinate of the fixation point (default: -1.0).
    
    y : float, optional
        The y-coordinate of the fixation point (default: -0.5).
    
    z : float, optional
        The z-coordinate of the fixation point (default: 1.0).

    Steps
    -----
    1. Starts the gaze movement towards the given fixation point.
    2. Does not wait for motion completion (`waitMotionDone=False`).
    3. Waits for the motion onset (`waitMotionOnset()`).
    4. Prints a confirmation message.
    5. Waits for the motion to complete (`waitMotionDone()`).
    6. Prints another confirmation message.

    Example
    -------
    >>> look_at_fixation_point_with_events(-1.0, -0.5, 1.0)

    Notes
    -----
    - This function provides real-time feedback on gaze motion events.
    - It is useful for synchronizing gaze movement with other robot actions.

def reset_gaze_to_neutral():
    """
    Resets the iCub's gaze to the absolute neutral angles.

    Example
    -------
    >>> reset_gaze_to_neutral()

    Notes
    -----
    - The gaze is reset by setting the azimuth (`azi`), elevation (`ele`), 
      and vergence (`ver`) angles to zero.
    - This function is useful for returning the gaze to a predefined reference position.
